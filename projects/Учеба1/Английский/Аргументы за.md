**Claim (утверждение):**  
In my view, education does not kill creativity. On the contrary, it gives us the tools to express it.

**Reason (обоснование):**  
Creativity is not only about having bright ideas. It is also about the ability to bring these ideas to life. Without knowledge and skills, even the most original imagination can remain just a dream. Education provides the necessary knowledge and techniques that allow people to transform their ideas into reality.

**Support (доказательства):**  
For example, engineers and architects use the skills they learn at university to design not only safe and functional buildings, but also beautiful and creative ones. Think about famous constructions like the Sydney Opera House or the Eiffel Tower. These masterpieces were possible because the creators combined creativity with professional education.

Another example is in technology. Many app developers or game designers studied programming first, and only after that they could use their creativity to build something new and useful. Without education, their creative vision would not have found a form.

**Conclusion (вывод):**  
So, for me this means that education is not an enemy of creativity, but its strongest partner. It gives us knowledge, methods, and instruments to make our imagination real. That is why I believe education develops creativity instead of stifling it.

**Claim (утверждение):**  
Personally, I think education does not destroy creativity. In fact, many of the most creative people in history studied at universities or received strong education, and this helped them to become even more innovative.

**Reason (обоснование):**  
Education gave them the knowledge, inspiration, and environment to explore their ideas. Creativity without knowledge is like a bird without wings: it may want to fly, but it cannot. Education gives these wings.

**Support (доказательства):**  
Take Albert Einstein as an example. He is one of the most creative scientists ever. His theory of relativity changed the way we understand the universe. But without years of studying physics and mathematics, he would never have had the tools to create such revolutionary ideas.

Another example is Steve Jobs. People say he was a genius of creativity and design. But his creativity grew from his studies in calligraphy and design, which later influenced the beautiful typography of Apple computers. So here we see how education shaped his creativity.

And let’s not forget Leonardo da Vinci. He studied anatomy, mathematics, and engineering. Thanks to this knowledge, his paintings and inventions were not only beautiful, but also scientifically precise and unique.

**Conclusion (вывод):**  
For me this means that education does not limit creativity — it supports and develops it. These great people show us that knowledge and imagination are strongest when they work together.

**Claim (утверждение):**  
In my view, education does not stifle creativity. On the contrary, it often develops creativity through teamwork and competition.

**Reason (обоснование):**  
When people study or work in teams, they want to impress their classmates, show their abilities, and sometimes even win against other groups. This natural competition makes students search for new, original solutions. In such situations, creativity becomes not just a choice, but a necessity.

**Support (доказательства):**  
For example, during school projects or university hackathons, students often compete to find the best solution for a task. They do not want to present something boring or ordinary, so they push themselves to think differently and more creatively. In fact, many successful startups, such as Facebook or Google, began as student projects where young people tried to show something unique to their peers.

Another strong example is architecture or engineering competitions. Teams of students design bridges, eco-houses, or robots. Because they want to stand out and impress the judges and their colleagues, they use both their education and their imagination to create something truly innovative.

**Conclusion (вывод):**  
So, for me this means that education creates the environment where teamwork and competition encourage creativity. Instead of killing it, education actually challenges students to be more original and to find better solutions.

Зная аспекты и подходы из разных наук мы можем комбинировать связи, создавать новое. Например математика: линейная алгебра и правило цепочки вместе с программированием дало нам LLM
```**Claim (утверждение):**  
I must say, education does not limit creativity. On the contrary, by teaching us different fields of knowledge, it gives us the power to combine ideas and create something completely new.

**Reason (обоснование):**  
When we know aspects and approaches from different sciences, we can connect them in unusual ways. This combination often leads to innovations that would be impossible without a solid educational background. Creativity is strongest when it is supported by knowledge from many areas.

**Support (доказательства):**  
Let me give an example. Mathematics and computer science together made a huge revolution in our world. Linear algebra, probability theory, and the chain rule from calculus may look abstract in a classroom. But when they were combined with programming skills, they became the foundation for modern artificial intelligence, including large language models like ChatGPT. This shows how education in several disciplines can be merged into something creative and groundbreaking.

Another example is medicine and engineering. Thanks to the combination of biology and technology, doctors can now use 3D printers to create artificial organs. This is a direct result of connecting knowledge from different subjects — something education makes possible.

**Conclusion (вывод):**  
So, for me this means that education is not the enemy of creativity. It provides the knowledge from many disciplines, and when we combine them, we can produce innovations that change the world. Education is the key that unlocks the door to creative discoveries.
