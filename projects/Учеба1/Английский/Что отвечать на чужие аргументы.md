## 🎤 Example 1

**B’s argument:**  
“Schools focus too much on tests and exams. Students just memorize facts instead of being creative.”

**C’s response:**  
It’s true that exams can sometimes make students focus on memorization. However, this is only one part of education. In fact, schools also give many opportunities to be creative: group projects, research, art, and even science experiments. For example, in my school we had to design our own presentations and solve real problems, not just answer test questions. So, I do think education is not only about memorization — it is about learning skills that later allow us to express creativity in a meaningful way.

## 🎤 Example 2

**B’s argument:**  
“Education forces everyone to think the same way. It kills individuality and original ideas.”

**C’s response:**  
I don’t agree with that. Education gives us the same foundation, but how we use it is up to us. In fact, by knowing the same basic principles, people can create very different things. For example, all musicians study notes and harmony, but their music is unique — compare Mozart, jazz, and modern pop. The same knowledge can lead to very different creative results. So, I must say, education does not destroy individuality, it gives us a starting point for our own creative path.

## 🎤 Example 3

**B’s argument:**  
“Children are naturally creative, but schools destroy this natural talent by making them follow strict rules.”

**C’s response:**  
I understand this opinion, but I do think rules are important. Rules do not kill creativity — they help us to focus and improve it. Imagine art without any technique, or science without logic: ideas would remain only dreams. With education, we learn discipline and skills, and then we can use them to be more creative. For example, Picasso first studied classical drawing before he created his unique style. Without education, he could not have expressed his creativity in such a powerful way.

## 🎤 Example 4

**B’s argument:**  
“Many famous innovators, like Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, dropped out of college. This means education is not necessary for creativity.”

**C’s response:**  
That’s a popular story, but it is not the full truth. Both Gates and Zuckerberg studied at Harvard before they left. Their time at university gave them strong knowledge, contacts, and inspiration to start their companies. Also, most innovators did finish education — Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Steve Jobs all used education to develop their creativity. So, I suggest we should not look at only a few examples, but at the bigger picture: education helps creativity much more often than it stops it.
